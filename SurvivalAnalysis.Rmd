# pval tells you if curves differ by race, pval.method = TRUE applies log-rank test (prints p-val to see if observed diffs are stat significantly)
```

Cox Prop Hazard Model (cox regressions)
```{r}
cox_reg1 = coxph(Surv(LOS, censored) ~ Race, data=data)
summary(cox_reg1) 
#coef -> euler's num ^coef 
#z=waldstat
#everything interpreted relative to the black group b/c its done alphabetically
#concordance -> how well did the model predicted individ. people's experience of event in terms of time; indicates how well model predicted event. Here, it's no better than a coin toss. SE variable of .014 says including our covariate, race improved our model very little. 
# Log rank test is significance you report with smaller sample sizes.
```
```{r}
cox_reg2 = coxph(Surv(LOS, censored) ~ Race + Pay_sat + Pay_hourly, data=data)
summary(cox_reg2)
```
Second table has hazard coefficients. Hourly coefficient is significant. Below, tells us risk of individual experiencing (voluntarily tourning over) the focal event will decrease by about 10.39% for every $ earned. Conf interval above relates to hazard ratio (.8961) not its reciprocal (1.1160)
```{r}
x = 1 - 0.8961
x
```

All are relative to the black reference group. Below equation simply an expression of the above coefficients.
```{r}
log_overall_risk = .121*hsp - .044*white -.110*pay_hourly + .141*pay_satisfaction
```
Log risk of above individual (hisp=1, white=0, pay_hourly=16, pay_satisfaction = 4.00) --> -1.075 --> exponentiation gets you .34129. 

Log value means overall risk of experiencing event; exponentiation tells us the overall risk of this individual who is hsp, non-white, makes 16/hr, & pay satisfaction of 4 out of possible 5, is .341. So, individual is 65% less likely to quit if coefficient of 0 attends each covariate in the model. If every coefficient is 0, the individual must be black (0 for hsp, 0 for white), however, pay would be $0, which implies slavery, and pay satisfaction would be 0, but we only want it to range between 0 and 1.  Here's how to fix that:

```{r}
# grand mean center continuous variables so you are making comparisons on avg variables
data$centered_hourly_pay = scale(data$pay_hourly, center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
data$centered_pay_satisfaction = scale(data$pay_sat, levels=c("Hispanic", "Black", "White"))

#Since our subject is Hisp, reorder levels to make Hispanic the reference group
data$hispanic = factor(data$race, levels=c("Hispanic", "Black", "White"))

#re-estimate cox proportional hazard model with categorical & continuous covariates
cox_reg3 = coxph(data(LOS, censored) ~ hispanic_race + pay_hourly + pay_sat, data=data)
summary(cox_reg3)

recalc then 1-% is reveals how much a hisp person is less likely to leave relative to other hispanics with average scores on non-race vars. 
```
